The project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for breast tumor classification using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Here's an overview of the key components:
1.	Environment Setup and GPU Configuration:
Configures GPU memory usage to 4000 MB with TensorFlow's set_virtual_device_configuration.
Verifies GPU availability and ensures reproducibility by setting random seeds.
2.	Preprocessing Pipeline:
Defines paths for storing preprocessed benign and malignant tumor images.
Resizes images to 224x224 pixels using TensorFlow and saves them in designated folders.
3.	Dataset Preparation:
Loads and resizes benign and malignant images, appending them to dataset and label lists.
Shuffles the dataset and applies one-hot encoding for binary classification (benign vs. malignant).
4.	Vision Transformer (ViT) Model Setup:
The ViT model includes:
Patch extraction and encoding using custom layers (Patches and PatchEncoder).
Multi-layer perception (MLP) heads with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks and custom activation functions.
Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and learning rate schedulers for performance tuning.
5.	Callbacks:
ActivationUpdater: Dynamically switches between activation functions (GELU, ReLU, LeakyReLU, Swish) based on validation accuracy.
CustomLearningRateScheduler and OneCycleLearningRateScheduler: Manage learning rates with different scheduling strategies during training.
StochasticWeightAveraging: Implements SWA to improve generalization by averaging model weights.
6.	Loss Functions:
A placeholder for sparse categorical cross-entropy with label smoothing to introduce smoothing in the training process.
7.	Advanced MLP Block:
Includes higher dropout (0.3) and L2 regularization (0.05) to address overfitting. These values may need further tuning to balance regularization and performance.
8.	Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA):
Integrates SWA with the Adam optimizer to smooth the loss landscape and improve performance.
Fine-tune the start of averaging (start_averaging=5) and average period (average_period=10) based on the number of epochs and convergence trends.
9.	Data Augmentation:
Augmentation is applied to both training and testing data, although focusing augmentation on the training set may provide a clearer final evaluation.
The current augmentation settings are designed to enhance generalization, with room for further experimentation (e.g., with shear_range and rotation_range) to improve performance on the breast tumor dataset.
10.	Callbacks:
Includes checkpoints, early stopping, a one-cycle learning rate scheduler, and activation updates to ensure efficient training and convergence.
The one-cycle learning rate policy helps monitor and optimize the learning process during training.
11.	Confusion Matrix and Metrics:
The model provides a detailed confusion matrix, along with precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, for thorough performance analysis.
Additional metrics like the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) or area under the ROC curve (AUC) can offer further insights, particularly for imbalanced datasets.
12.	Handling Imbalanced Data:
Data augmentation is applied per class to balance the dataset, reducing bias toward the majority class.
The use of loss functions designed for handling class imbalance, such as focal loss, can be explored alongside sparse categorical cross-entropy, which has shown promising results.
13.	Performance Tracking:
Checkpoints save the best models for each fold, ensuring the retrieval of optimal models during cross-validation.
Ensemble predictions from all k-fold models after cross-validation can further improve test accuracy and generalization.
This pipeline is designed for flexibility and experimentation, allowing for adjustments to optimize breast tumor classification performance.
